## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization  
Explore and visualize health data to uncover trends and correlations between attributes like glucose, BMI, and insulin.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Models  
Implements multiple algorithms for comparison:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 📈 Model Evaluation  
Evaluate models using:
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
- ROC Curve and AUC Score  

### 💡 Insights  
- **Glucose**, **BMI**, and **Age** are the most influential factors.  
- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy (~85%).  
- Ensemble methods improve predictive performance and robustness.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Load and Explore Data**  
   - Import and clean dataset using `pandas`.  
   - Identify missing or zero-value entries.

2. **Preprocess Data**  
   - Standardize features with `StandardScaler`.  
   - Split dataset (80% training / 20% testing).  

3. **Train ML Models**  
   - Apply multiple classifiers from `scikit-learn`.  
   - Perform model comparison using performance metrics.

4. **Evaluate and Visualize**  
   - Generate accuracy scores and confusion matrices.  
   - Visualize model outcomes with plots and metrics.  

5. **Select Best Model**  
   - Random Forest and Logistic Regression deliver top accuracy.
